You know, me,
I never set foot on a yacht

until I started
dating Bobby.

In inwood, growing up,

the only boating we ever did
was the staten island ferry.

Big Irish family.
Five sibs.

Close, though.

Firemen, cops, nurses.

Then,
when I moved up here,

this world, I saw
how everyone looked at me.

I never judged.

Of course not.

So I got my act together.

And I'm comfortable
in this life.

But certain things
you learn in inwood,

they never leave you --
you know, like the idea

that if someone
has a problem with you

and they come to you
in person,

you do what you can
to take care of it.

But if they take
that beef public,

the ground just falls out from
beneath them where I'm from.

You find yourself
all alone.

Are you threatening me?

You're fucking right I am.

It's how I grew up.

Excuse me, sir?

Yes?

I may be speaking
out of turn --

I probably shouldn't have even
been in the room

where axelrod
was discussed --

but you know the Norton place
out at the beach?

Why would we?
Not you.
The U.S. attorney.

His father's house
is around the jetty.

Yes, I know the house.
What?

I just heard Bobby axelrod
is trying to buy it.

Where did
you hear that?

Court clerk's cousin works for
the realtor and mentioned it.

How much?
$83 million.

Really?

That would be
widely reported.

Widely.

People hate guys
who buy things like that.

I just lost my mojo
somewhere along the line.

It's fucking gone.

And you're Mrs. mojo,
so I booked the appointment.
hey practice
